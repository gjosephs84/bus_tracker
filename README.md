# Description
When the button is clicked, the map displays the location of all currently-running MBTA buses on Route 77 between Harvard Station and Arlington Heights. The map updates the location markers of the buses every fifteen seconds.

# Roadmap of future improvements
In future updates, I would like to update the colors of the markers to indicate inbound and outbound buses. I will also add a mechanism to account for when buses come in and out of service.
